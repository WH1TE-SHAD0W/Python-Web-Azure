        <p class="description" style="padding-top: 2em">
            Monolithic approach makes is a single unit software architecture.
            Able to use only sequential development.
            While agile approach of software architecture breaks every sevtion apart and makes it modular.
            This is allowing the system to be fastly developed with better maintence and freqent updates.
            Every service is controlled by microservice manager.
            Such services are usually installed seperatelly and together makes one functional aplication.
